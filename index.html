                    <p>The Seljuks were a medieval Turkish dynasty that ruled over parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to the 14th century. The Seljuk Empire was founded by Seljuk Bey, a Turkic chieftain who migrated with his followers from the steppes of Central Asia to Iran in the mid-11th century.</p>

                    <p>Under the leadership of Seljuk Bey's grandson, Tughril Beg, the Seljuks conquered the city of Baghdad in 1055, which was then the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, and established their rule over much of the Islamic world.</p>

                    <p>The Seljuk Empire eventually declined and was gradually replaced by other dynasties in the 13th and 14th centuries, including the Mongols and the Ottomans. However, the Seljuks played an important role in the history of the Middle East and Central Asia, and their legacy continues to be felt in the region today.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center border-bottom border-secondary text-danger-emphasis mb-5">The Height and the Decline</h1>
        
        <p>At its height, the Seljuk Empire spanned a vast territory that extended from Central Asia in the east to Anatolia and the Levant in the west. The Seljuks established their rule over much of the Iranian plateau, including parts of modern-day Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. They also expanded into Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), where they founded the Sultanate of Rum, and into the Levant, where they established the Seljuk Sultanate of Syria.</p>

        <p>The Seljuk Empire reached the height of its power under the rule of Sultan Malik Shah I, who oversaw the expansion of the empire into parts of Central Asia and the Caucasus. However, after his death in 1092, the empire began to decline due to internal power struggles and external pressures from the Crusaders and other neighboring empires.</p>

        </div>

        <p>By the 12th century, the Seljuk Empire had fragmented into a number of smaller states, including the Sultanate of Rum, the Seljuk Sultanate of Syria, and the Khwarazmian Empire.</p>

        <div class="d-md-flex justify-content-evenly">
           
            <div class="container">
                <p>Malik Shah I had several sons, and after his death, there was a struggle for the throne among them. The eldest son, Barkiyaruq, was initially recognized as the new sultan, but his authority was challenged by his younger brothers, who each established their own independent realms. This led to a period of civil war and conflict, as the Seljuk princes fought for control of various parts of the empire. </p>
                <p>In addition to the internal conflicts, the Seljuks faced external threats from neighboring empires and kingdoms. The Byzantine Empire, for example, took advantage of the Seljuk fragmentation to expand its territory in Anatolia, while the Crusaders launched a series of invasions into the Levant, which weakened the Seljuk hold on the region.</p>

                <p>The fragmentation of the Seljuk Empire led to the emergence of several independent Seljuk states, including the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia and the Seljuk Sultanate of Syria. These states continued to play an important role in the politics of the region for several centuries, but they never regained the power and influence that the Seljuk Empire had enjoyed under Malik Shah I.</p>

            <p>What would have made this even more interesting to me is if we got an anime series about the Seljuks. How cool would it be seeing Alp Arslan during the Battle of Manzikert in anime form! And we got that Demon Slayer level animation quality! </p>

            <p>Below are a few AI generated images in anime-esque artstyle. Just imagine if we got a whole series looking like this! </p>
